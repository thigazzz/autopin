## Introduction

Welcome to the official Autopin repository. This project aims to recommend photos from various Pinterest Explore topics through an automated CLI. The CLI displays links to images extracted through web scraping.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following technologies:
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4

### Why We Use These Technologies:
This web scraping project is not complex enough to warrant the use of more robust tools like Scrapy. Therefore, we opted for libraries that are simpler to implement and provide quick results.

## Why the Project Was Created
As I am studying Robotic Process Automation (RPA), specifically focusing on web scraping, I decided to undertake this project to apply the knowledge I acquired to a lightweight theme.
